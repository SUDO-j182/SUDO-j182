👋 Need something fixed or built?

I help clients solve small front-end problems and create lightweight custom tools using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My repos show the kind of work I do: clean UI updates, bug fixes, responsive layouts, and small tools that solve real, practical problems.

🔧 What I Can Help You With

Fixing layout, styling, and UI issues

Debugging JavaScript behaviour and errors

Improving responsiveness and consistency

Cleaning up or modernising older designs

Building small, custom web tools (calculators, generators, converters, etc.)

Everything is built to be clear, maintainable, and easy to integrate into your existing site.

🧩 Projects You’ll Find Here

Mini tools – focused utilities built with simple JS

UI improvements – modernised interfaces and components

Debugging examples – before/after fixes and code clarity

Frontend demos – small, practical showcases of what I can build

These projects exist so you can see the quality of work you’ll receive.

🚀 How I Work

Fast communication

Simple, direct explanations

Clean code and clear file structure

Step-by-step updates if needed

No over-engineering, just practical solutions

Whether it’s fixing one issue or building a small tool from scratch, I aim to keep the process smooth and predictable.
