# From Warehousing to Web Development - Learning by Doing

I’ve spent the last few years working in warehouses and factories, where I learned the value of hard work, problem-solving, and staying consistent under pressure. But I’ve always had a deep interest in computers, websites, and how software works behind the scenes.

Now I’m turning that interest into a career by learning web development the practical way, building real projects, solving real problems, and constantly improving. I work mainly with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **Git**, and I’ve built things like:

- [**Pixel Editor**](https://sudo-j182.github.io/pixel-editor/) - custom grid logic, hover preview, drag-to-paint, and export as PNG  
- [**Password Generator**](https://sudo-j182.github.io/password-generator/) - random password creation with a styled retro terminal look  
- [**CV Webpage**](https://sudo-j182.github.io/cv-page/) - responsive design built for PDF export and mobile display  
- [**Portfolio Website**](https://www.portfolio-os.net) – Modern, sleek layout with semantic structure and custom effects  
[**Code Editor**](https://sudo-j182.github.io/code-editor/) - A simple browser based code editor that accepts HTML, CSS and JavaScript, includes a console for handling JS and retro inspired design 


I’ve also taken fundamental online courses in **cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI**, and I’m working through FreeCodeCamp’s **Responsive Web Design** certification.

Programming gives me something to focus on, and I’ve found it’s a great way to channel my ADHD into something creative, structured, and rewarding.

Right now I’m working towards a **junior developer role in the Civil Service** or **public sector**, where I hope to apply my skills to projects that actually make a difference.

> Always learning. Always Building.
